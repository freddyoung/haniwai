    <h2 class="highlight-heading fade-in-up">What is HANIWAI?</h2>
    <p>
      The Human and Nature Indigenous Women’s Association Inc. (HANIWAI) is an Indigenous women-led non-profit organization based in Papua New Guinea. Our mission is to empower marginalized communities and protect ancestral knowledge throughout PNG and the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide safe spaces, shelter, counseling, and support for Indigenous women and children affected by domestic violence, sorcery-related accusations, homelessness, tribal conflict, and other forms of injustice and trauma. We stand with widows, orphans, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and other outcast or vulnerable members of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through community workshops, awareness campaigns, protest marches, and cultural education, we work to break cycles of violence and discrimination. At HANIWAI, we believe in healing, solidarity, and reclaiming dignity — together, and live by our motto to <b>Preserve, Protect and Transform</b>.
