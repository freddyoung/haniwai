    <h2 class="highlight-heading fade-in-up">What is HANIWAI?</h2>
    <p>
      The Humanity and Nature Indigenous Women‚Äôs Association Inc. (HANIWAI) is an Indigenous women-led non-profit organization based in Papua New Guinea. Our mission is to empower marginalized communities and protect ancestral knowledge throughout PNG and the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide safe spaces, shelter, counseling, and support for Indigenous women and children affected by domestic violence, sorcery-related accusations, homelessness, tribal conflict, and other forms of injustice and trauma. We stand with widows, orphans, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and other outcast or vulnerable members of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through community workshops, awareness campaigns, protest marches, and cultural education, we work to break cycles of violence and discrimination. At HANIWAI, we believe in healing, solidarity, and reclaiming dignity ‚Äî together, and live by our motto to <b>Preserve, Protect and Transform</b>.
